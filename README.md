# ArchGuard AI

An open-source, enterprise-grade AI Architect Agent for GitHub Actions that automatically audits Pull Requests for clean architecture boundaries, infrastructure decoupling, and critical security flaws before code hits production.

---

## Why ArchGuard AI?

Most automated code reviewers catch syntax errors, linting issues, or formatting style drifts. ArchGuard AI acts as a virtual Senior Software Architect embedded in your CI/CD pipeline, enforcing architectural standards and catching deep design flaws that traditional linters completely miss.

### Key Audit Pillars:
* Architectural Decoupling: Detects infrastructure leakage (e.g., when Controllers, Use Cases, or Domain layers directly invoke Mongoose models, Sequelize definitions, Redis clients, or Axios handlers without a clean abstraction/repository layer).
* Stateless and Enterprise Security: Spots critical architectural vulnerabilities like Mass Assignment (dumping unvalidated client req.body directly into database creation, especially fields like role or permissions), hardcoded secrets, and missing global error handlers.
* 1-Touch Smart Fixes: Generates real-time structural refactoring code blocks directly using GitHub's native markdown suggestion format. You can apply the architectural fix with a single click.

## Architecture Overview
ArchGuard AI is designed with an Enterprise-grade Serverless Edge Architecture to ensure zero-maintenance, infinite scalability, and top-tier security. The project is split into two components:
* Client Side (GitHub Action Runner): [archguard-labs/action](https://github.com/archguard-labs/action)
* Server Side (Edge Gateway): [archguard-labs/gateway](https://github.com/archguard-labs/gateway)

```

* **Zero-Trust OIDC Authentication**: We use GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) to establish a secure, cryptographic identity. No API keys or secrets are required or stored.
* **Zero-Data Retention Policy**: Your source code is analyzed at the edge on stateless serverless infrastructure. No data is cached, stored, logged, or used for model training, satisfying strict banking and fintech security requirements.
* **Fault-Tolerant Pipeline**: Built with an asynchronous queue network and a dynamic AI model fallback matrix to ensure 100% availability and prevent GitHub runner execution timeouts.

## Quick Start (30 Seconds Integration)

ArchGuard AI offers two flexible ways to run: **Free Serverless Gateway** (Default) or **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**.

### Option 1: Free Serverless Gateway (Default)
To integrate ArchGuard AI into your repository using our free edge AI gateway, create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/archguard.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: ArchGuard AI Architectural Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  archguard-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write # Required for ArchGuard to publish PR comments
      contents: read       # Required to read the PR diff
      id-token: write      # Required for Zero-Trust OIDC Authentication
    steps:
      - name: Run ArchGuard AI Auditor
        uses: archguard-labs/action@main  # Replace @main with @v1.x tags for stable production environments
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # CUSTOM_PROMPT: "Optional: Reject any PR that uses Vue Mixins or hardcodes SQL queries."
```

### Option 2: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
If you prefer complete data privacy or want to use your own LLM limits, you can route the AI processing directly to your own provider (e.g. OpenAI, DeepSeek, or any custom endpoint), completely bypassing our free gateway.

```yaml
name: ArchGuard AI Architectural Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  archguard-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Run ArchGuard AI Auditor
        uses: archguard-labs/action@main
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          AGENT_AI_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} # Triggers BYOK mode
          AI_PROVIDER_URL: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" # Optional (Defaults to OpenAI)
          AI_MODEL: "gpt-4o" # Optional (Defaults to gpt-4o)
          # CUSTOM_PROMPT: "Optional: Reject any PR that uses Vue Mixins or hardcodes SQL queries."
```

## Inputs Configuration

| Input Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Automatically generated repository token to authorize ArchGuard to post structural review comments onto your Pull Requests. | **Yes** | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `AGENT_AI_KEY` | (Optional) Your custom API key. If provided, the action switches to BYOK mode and completely bypasses the free serverless gateway. | No | N/A |
| `AI_PROVIDER_URL` | (Optional) The custom AI API endpoint to call. Only used if `AGENT_AI_KEY` is set. | No | `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` |
| `AI_MODEL` | (Optional) The specific LLM to use for your provider. Only used if `AGENT_AI_KEY` is set. | No | `gpt-4o` |
| `CUSTOM_PROMPT` | (Optional) Inject your own company-specific architectural rules or coding standards directly into the AI's Brain (System Prompt). | No | N/A |
