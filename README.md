# ArchGuard AI

An open-source, enterprise-grade AI Architect Agent for GitHub Actions that automatically audits Pull Requests for clean architecture boundaries, infrastructure decoupling, and critical security flaws before code hits production.

---

## Why ArchGuard AI?

Most automated code reviewers catch syntax errors, linting issues, or formatting style drifts. ArchGuard AI acts as a virtual Senior Software Architect embedded in your CI/CD pipeline, enforcing architectural standards and catching deep design flaws that traditional linters completely miss.

### Key Audit Pillars:
* Architectural Decoupling: Detects infrastructure leakage (e.g., when Controllers, Use Cases, or Domain layers directly invoke Mongoose models, Sequelize definitions, Redis clients, or Axios handlers without a clean abstraction/repository layer).
* Stateless and Enterprise Security: Spots critical architectural vulnerabilities like Mass Assignment (dumping unvalidated client req.body directly into database creation, especially fields like role or permissions), hardcoded secrets, and missing global error handlers.
* 1-Touch Smart Fixes: Generates real-time structural refactoring code blocks directly using GitHub's native markdown suggestion format. You can apply the architectural fix with a single click.

## Architecture Overview
ArchGuard AI is designed with an Enterprise-grade Serverless Edge Architecture to ensure zero-maintenance, infinite scalability, and top-tier security. The project is split into two components:
* Client Side (GitHub Action Runner): [archguard-ai](https://github.com/paudang/archguard-ai)
* Server Side (Edge Gateway): [archguard-gateway](https://github.com/paudang/archguard-gateway)

* Zero-Data Retention Policy: Your source code is analyzed at the edge on serverless infrastructure. No data is cached, stored, or used for model training, satisfying strict banking and fintech security requirements.
* Fault-Tolerant Pipeline: Built with an asynchronous queue network and a dynamic AI model fallback matrix to ensure 100% availability and prevent GitHub runner execution timeouts.

## Quick Start (30 Seconds Integration)

To integrate ArchGuard AI into your repository, create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/archguard.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: ArchGuard AI Architectural Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  archguard-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write # Required for ArchGuard to publish PR comments
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Run ArchGuard AI Auditor
        uses: paudang/archguard-ai@main  # Replace @main with @v1.x tags for stable production environments
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs Configuration

| Input Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Automatically generated repository token to authorize ArchGuard to post structural review comments onto your Pull Requests. | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AGENT_AI_KEY` | (Optional) A custom API key if you want to route the processing payload to your private enterprise AI endpoint instead of our free serverless edge tier. | No | N/A|
